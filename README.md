# Python API Use Case Challenge
This challenge utilized Python based tools for weather data analysis using Open Weather Data and Geoapify APIs.
Part one consisted of creating a random list of cities using Citipy, then using Open Weather Data and Geoapify APIs to create plots and statistical analyses that could highlight the relationship between weather variables and latitude. 
Part two further analyzed the created city list to narrow focus to a set of ideal weather parameters, and then find the closest hotel within those constraints.
